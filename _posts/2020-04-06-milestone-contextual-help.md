Nobody likes to get stuck while aiming to complete a task. While help portal still remains solid, we want to aid our users at the right time, to provide the correct information when they need it. Contextual help can be accessed from the Menu – by hitting the „?” icon. It will open a panel with relevant information for the page our user is browsing at the moment.
